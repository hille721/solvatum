  Abstract                 = {Literature data on partitioning of compounds from the gas phase to a number of amides and from water to the amides has been collected and analyzed through the Abraham solvation equations. The resulting equations are statistically good enough to be used for the prediction of further partition coefficients{,} and allow deductions to be made about the chemical properties of the amides{,} as solvents. For example{,} tertiary amides have no hydrogen bond property at all{,} secondary amides are rather weak hydrogen bond acids{,} and primary amides are stronger hydrogen bond acids than are alcohols as solvents. Equations for partitioning from the gas phase to amide solvents can also be used to test if the amides are possible models for a number of biological phases and biological processes. It is shown that no organic solvent is a suitable model for phases such as blood{,} brain{,} muscle{,} liver{,} heart or kidney{,} but that a number of rather non-polar solvents are models for fat. N-Methylformamide is shown to be the best (and excellent) model for eye irritation and nasal pungency in humans{,} suggesting that the receptor site in these processes is protein-like.},

Application of the Abraham solvation equations to the sets of partition coefficients leads to equations that correlate log P12 to 0.20 units and log K12 to 0.11 units. Consideration of results on independent test sets suggests that log P12 could be predicted to 0.2 to 0.3 units{,} and that log K12 could be predicted to 0.1 to 0.2 units. A smaller data set of 66 solutes has been assembled for undecane. Similar equations lead to correlations for log P11 and for log K11 that indicate these quantities could be predicted to 0.2 to 0.3 log units.},

Wet octanol is a poor model{,} as are all polar organic solvents. The egg lecithin bilayer is non-polar and has only weak hydrogen bond acidity and weak hydrogen bond basicity. Comparison of equations for permeation through egg lecithin bilayers{,} through the human intestinal membrane{,} through the blood-brain membrane and through human skin shows that these four permeation processes are chemically far apart. It is not possible to obtain any general model for permeation: each permeation process requires a different model system.},

It is shown that for the wide range of solutes studied{,} partitions into the dry and wet (water-saturated) solvents are essentially the same{,} and that equations can be constructed that include data on both dry and wet solvents. Using the Abraham equations{,} that contain a maximum of five descriptors{,} statistically satisfactory equations are obtained for log Ks and log Ps with estimated predictive standard deviations of around 0.20 log units. The coefficients in the Abraham equations for the four halobenzene solvents are surprisingly similar and except for the s-coefficient{,} which reflects the solvent dipolarity/polarisability{,} are also similar to the coefficients for partition into toluene.},

Application of the general linear free energy relationship solvation equations shows that there are small{,} but significant{,} differences in the solvation behaviour of wet and dry DBE. In particular{,} the partition of acidic solutes into wet DBE is favoured over partition into dry DBE. An analysis based on the water-dragging effect of Testa et al. (J. Am. Chem.

The logarithms of the water-to-ether partition coefficients, log10 P, and gas-to-ether partition coefficients, log10 K, were correlated with the Abraham solvation parameter model. The derived correlations described the observed log10 P and log10 K values for both ether solvents to within average standard deviations of 0.16 log10 units or less. The log10 P correlation for tetrahydrofuran was extended to include the partition of ions by inclusion of a cation-solvent and an anion-solvent term.},

Solubilities were also determined at 298.15Â K for 23 crystalline nonelectrolyte organic compounds in triethylene glycol based on spectroscopic absorbance measurements. The experimental results of the headspace chromatographic and spectroscopic solubility measurements were converted to gas-to-triethylene glycol and water-to-triethylene glycol partition coefficients, and molar solubility ratios using standard thermodynamic relationships. Expressions were derived for solute transfer into triethylene glycol by combining our measured experimental values with published literature data. Mathematical correlations based on the Abraham model describe the observed partition coefficient and solubility data to within 0.16 log10 units (or less).},
