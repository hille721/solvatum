  Abstract                 = {Literature data on partitioning of compounds from the gas phase to a number of amides and from water to the amides has been collected and analyzed through the Abraham solvation equations. The resulting equations are statistically good enough to be used for the prediction of further partition coefficients{,} and allow deductions to be made about the chemical properties of the amides{,} as solvents. For example{,} tertiary amides have no hydrogen bond property at all{,} secondary amides are rather weak hydrogen bond acids{,} and primary amides are stronger hydrogen bond acids than are alcohols as solvents. Equations for partitioning from the gas phase to amide solvents can also be used to test if the amides are possible models for a number of biological phases and biological processes. It is shown that no organic solvent is a suitable model for phases such as blood{,} brain{,} muscle{,} liver{,} heart or kidney{,} but that a number of rather non-polar solvents are models for fat. N-Methylformamide is shown to be the best (and excellent) model for eye irritation and nasal pungency in humans{,} suggesting that the receptor site in these processes is protein-like.},

Application of the Abraham solvation equations to the sets of partition coefficients leads to equations that correlate log P12 to 0.20 units and log K12 to 0.11 units. Consideration of results on independent test sets suggests that log P12 could be predicted to 0.2 to 0.3 units{,} and that log K12 could be predicted to 0.1 to 0.2 units. A smaller data set of 66 solutes has been assembled for undecane. Similar equations lead to correlations for log P11 and for log K11 that indicate these quantities could be predicted to 0.2 to 0.3 log units.},

The logarithms of the water-to-ether partition coefficients, log10 P, and gas-to-ether partition coefficients, log10 K, were correlated with the Abraham solvation parameter model. The derived correlations described the observed log10 P and log10 K values for both ether solvents to within average standard deviations of 0.16 log10 units or less. The log10 P correlation for tetrahydrofuran was extended to include the partition of ions by inclusion of a cation-solvent and an anion-solvent term.},

  Abstract                 = {A gas chromatographic headspace analysis method was used to experimentally determine gas-to-liquid partition coefficients and infinite dilution activity coefficients for 29 liquid organic solutes dissolved in triethylene glycol at 298.15 K. Solubilities were also determined at 298.15 K for 23 crystalline nonelectrolyte organic compounds in triethylene glycol based on spectroscopic absorbance measurements. The experimental results of the headspace chromatographic and spectroscopic solubility measurements were converted to gas-to-triethylene glycol and water-to-triethylene glycol partition coefficients, and molar solubility ratios using standard thermodynamic relationships. Expressions were derived for solute transfer into triethylene glycol by combining our measured experimental values with published literature data. Mathematical correlations based on the Abraham model describe the observed partition coefficient and solubility data to within 0.16 log10 units (or less).},

It is shown that polarisability effects favour solvation in methylene iodide{,} through the term{,} but that such effects enhance the solubility of polarisable solutes only moderately: thus the term contributes 0.4 log units more in methylene iodide than in trichloromethane for the solute benzene. Examination of [capital Delta][degree]{,} [capital Delta][degree] and [capital Delta][degree] for solvation of gaseous solutes suggests also that polarisability effects in methylene iodide are not very much larger than in the other halogenated solvents.},

The method described is self-calibrating and allows the rapid determination of gas solubilities. It is found that the acetonitrile solubility varies nonlinearly, and nonmonotonically, in the mixed solvents, passing through maxima in the aqueous alcohol and 1,4-dioxane systems and showing a shallow minimum in the aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide mixtures.},

  abstract = {Solute descriptors of linear solvation energy relationship (LSER) for dialkyl ethers were examined as a means for improving predictions of their fate and behavior in the environment. LSER solute descriptors consist of the excess molar refraction, the polarizability/dipolarity parameter, the effective hydrogen (H)-bond acidity/basicity, McGowan's characteristic volume and the hexadecane–air partitioning coefficient. Descriptor determination was done based on partitioning coefficients measured in this study for six alkyl ethers including linear and branched compounds. Calibration of the solute descriptors revealed that the effective solute H-bond basicity of branched ethers is significantly higher than that of linear ethers, which has been neglected in previous LSER studies. Revised solute descriptors accurately calculated measured partitioning coefficients in most systems. The inspection of solute H-bond basicities of ethers in different solvent–water and solvent–air systems suggested that the H-bond basicity of an ether can vary depending on the solvent in which the ether dissolves. Neglecting this donor-dependency of the H-bond basicity could lead to significantly poorer estimations by the LSER, when the solvent or sorbent of concern is a strong H-bond acid. Other H-bond basic compounds possibly pose a donor-dependent basicity as well.},

Abraham model correlations were developed for describing solute transfer into both propanenitrile and butanenitrile by combining our measured solubility data with the partition coefficients that we calculated from the published activity coefficient data. The derived Abraham model correlations were found to back-calculate the observed partition coefficients and molar solubility data to within 0.14 log units.},

This improved, medium-precision apparatus (the imprecision is approximately ±0.5\%) combines easy handling with automated data retrieval and is totally mercury-free. Data reduction is presented in some detail, including the estimation of auxiliary quantities, such as second virial coefficients and partial molar volumes at infinite dilution. The effect of chain length l upon solubility is shown, and some correlations between L2,1, or the derived Henry fugacities H2,1, and appropriate molecular and/or bulk properties of the gases and n-alkanes are discussed.},

  abstract = {A new charge model, called Charge Model 4 (CM4), and a new continuum solvent model, called Solvation Model 6 (SM6), are presented. Using a database of aqueous solvation free energies for 273 neutrals, 112 ions, and 31 ion−water clusters, parameter sets for the mPW0 hybrid density functional of Adamo and Barone (Adamo, C.; Barone, V. J. Chem. Phys. 1998, 108, 664−675) were optimized for use with the following four basis sets:  MIDI!6D, 6-31G(d), 6-31+G(d), and 6-31+G(d,p). SM6 separates the observable aqueous solvation free energy into two different components:  one arising from long-range bulk electrostatic effects and a second from short-range interactions between the solute and solvent molecules in the first solvation shell. This partition of the observable solvation free energy allows SM6 to effectively model a wide range of solutes. For the 273 neutral solutes in the test set, SM6 achieves an average error of ∼0.50 kcal/mol in the aqueous solvation free energies. For solutes, especially ions, that have highly concentrated regions of charge density, adding an explicit water molecule to the calculation significantly improves the performance of SM6 for predicting solvation free energies. The performance of SM6 was tested against several other continuum models, including SM5.43R and several different implementations of the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM). For both neutral and ionic solutes, SM6 outperforms all of the models against which it was tested. Also, SM6 is the only model (except for one with an average error 3.4 times larger) that improves when an explicit solvent molecule is added to solutes with concentrated charge densities. Thus, in SM6, unlike the other continuum models tested here, adding one or more explicit solvent molecules to the calculation is an effective strategy for improving the prediction of the aqueous solvation free energies of solutes with strong local solute−solvent interactions. This is important, because local solute−solvent interactions are not specifically accounted for by bulk electrostatics, but modeling these interactions correctly is important for predicting the aqueous solvation free energies of certain solutes. Finally, SM6 retains its accuracy when used in conjunction with the B3LYP and B3PW91 functionals, and in fact the solvation parameters obtained with a given basis set may be used with any good density functional or fraction of Hartree−Fock exchange.},

Excess molar Gibbs energies, GE, for the investigated mixtures were obtained by a least-squares treatment of the equilibrium results (x–y). The GE values are positive for all the systems and increase with increasing the ratio of oxygen to carbon atoms in the ether molecule. There is clear evidence for the effect of position of the oxygen atom in the chain structure of monoethers as well as for the effect of distance of two -0- groups in diethers. The behaviour of the activity coefficients at infinite dilution and of the free energies of solvation as well as of molar excess entropies, obtained from GE and the known excess enthalpies, are briefly discussed. The experimental GE values are compared with the predictions of a group contribution model in the random-mixing approximation.},

Results showed that SO2F2 solubility increased with increasing pressure and decreased with increasing temperature in the three solvents, and the dissolution of SO2F2 in the solvents was a physical process. Moreover, Henry’s law constants and thermodynamic properties such as standard Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy changes of SO2F2 solvation were further calculated according to the experimental solubility data. The solubility of SO2F2 in these three solvents followed the order of TBP > PC > NMP. The results illustrated that TBP possessed the potentiality to capture SO2F2 among the present absorbents due to the relatively large solubility and low absorption enthalpy for SO2F2.},

Comparative ebulliometry was used to measure activity coefficients at infinite dilution for binary systems of the oxygenated fuel additives methyl tertiary butyl ether, diisopropyl ether and ethanol with alkanes. The possibility of obtaining parameters for equations of state mixing rules from infinite dilution activity coefficients data was studied. The predictive abilities of some recent equation of state mixing rules which incorporate excess Gibbs free energy models were critically evaluated, and a simple empirical technique for the evaluation of binary interaction parameters in cubic equations of state using infinite dilution activity coefficient data is proposed.},

For the same compounds, the values of limiting activity coefficients in formamide were determined using GC headspace analysis at 298K, and Gibbs free energies of solution and solvation were calculated. Based on these data and the available literature values of the Gibbs free energy of solvation in formamide for a number of other low-polar solutes, a study of the solvophobic effect in this solvent is performed, and its resemblance to the hydrophobic effect in aqueous solutions is demonstrated. It is shown that the contribution of the solvophobic effect into the solvation Gibbs free energy in formamide is much higher than that in aliphatic alcohols, but lower than that in water. Like in water, the magnitude of this contribution for different solutes linearly increases with the solute molecular volume. Solvophobic effect also significantly affects the enthalpies of dissolution in formamide, causing them to be more negative in the case of alkanes and more positive in the case of arenes.},
